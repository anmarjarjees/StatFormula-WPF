-	The main executable file to launch the application is “StatFormula.exe”, double click it and that’s it, you are good to go.

### How to use StatFormula:
-	The application was designed to have a very simple and user friendly interface. You can write your numbers inside the main values box then click calculate to get your results.
-	Users can save their entered values plus their formula results into a simple text file (.TXT). They can open their saved values (inside the text file) with StatFormula (recommended) to modify them, or they can open the text file in windows explorer using notepad.
-	Please be advised that when you try to modify your values using notepad, make sure to add at least one-line space after the last number in your values (numbers) or don’t type anything. Ignoring the line space will lead to an invalid input or discarding the rest of the numbers that come after the line space.
-	The only delimiter that users allowed to type between each number are: space or comma. To prevent the user from making any mistake by entering invalid data, the program was build and designed to handle the unusual user input like:
Characters or text values, Extra white spaces, or the + – operators
